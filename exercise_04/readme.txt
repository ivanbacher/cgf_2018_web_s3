The criteria we’ll be looking at are as follows. You can see the ​Must have ​criteria and the Nice to have​. It would be great to have as many Nice to have features as possible, but don’t worry we know you won’t have time to include it all! Anything you don’t get time to include now, can always be added later on.



Must have:
 - A live website published on GitHub pages
 - A minimum of​ two​ HTML files for:
   - 1 x landing page linked to a separate CSS file
   - 1 x ‘about’ page
 - A minimum of​ one​ CSS files
 - Good formatting
   - Code split into the appropriate files (separate HTML files & CSS files)
   - Files indented properly
 - Good organisation
 - Version control using git
 - Sensible git commit messages



Nice to have:
 - A visually appealing design - good use of CSS and HTML elements, Twitter Bootstrap, Jquery & JavaScript
 - A contact form (for example name and email)
 - Social buttons
 - As many different HTML elements you can manage
 -Interactive elements (like forms) on your website don’t need to be functional, but
should be present if they need to be for the visual aspect of the design.
 - A responsive site

You can see a few examples of what previous students on your course created on our website here: http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/course-competition.html


If you’re short on ideas, here are some to get you going...
 - A personal website
 - “How to” website on an area of your expertise
 - A survey or poll website.
